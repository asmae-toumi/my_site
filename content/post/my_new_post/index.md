Hello.
======

I had to use another computer to do this after spending an entire night fighting pandoc. pandoc, if you're listening, i hate you. what in the hell is "error of type 1"?

Anyway, let's test this out:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span class='m'>2</span><span class='o'>+</span><span class='m'>2</span>
<span class='c'>#&gt; [1] 4</span></code></pre>

</div>

Quick maths!
